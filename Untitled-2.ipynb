    "Synthetic seismograms of a random number of seismic events are generated using a ricker wavelet. Random characteristics of these seismic events include:\n",

    "Frequency (between 10 and 70Hz)\n",
    "Angle (beween +/- 50 degrees)\n",
    "Amplitude (between +/- 2) These seismograms are the target output of the network. A random level of Gaussian noise is then added to the clean seismic data; this dataset is the input to the network.\n",
    "Model generation:\n",
    "A number of models have been (and still are being) tested to give optimum results. These models include:\n",

    "Fitting models:\n",
    "These models are then fit to the synthetic data to effectively remove the random noise. Optimizer = SGD, loss function = MSE."
